## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate **ModbusKit** into your project using Swift Package Manager, add the following to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/schneim/ModbusKit.git", from: "1.0.0")
]


Then run swift package update in your project directory.

Usage

Modbus TCP Client

import ModbusKit

// Create a Modbus TCP client
let client = ModbusTCPClient(host: "192.168.1.100", port: 502)

do {
    // Connect to the Modbus server
    try client.connect()

    // Read holding registers (function code 03)
    let response = try client.readHoldingRegisters(address: 0x10, quantity: 2)
    print("Received data: \(response)")

    // Write a value to a coil (function code 05)
    try client.writeSingleCoil(address: 0x01, value: true)

    // Disconnect when done
    client.disconnect()
} catch {
    print("Modbus error: \(error)")
}
